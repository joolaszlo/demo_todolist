# demo_todolist âœ…
<sub>(backend only / spring boot 2.5.6 / java 11)</sub>

 As a recent graduate **Java Backend Developer**, I want to present my first demo program. This application is a simple "ToDo" management system that allows users to register, create new tasks, edit and delete them, and manage their profiles. Additionally, it features a password recovery mechanism secured with email token verification.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the program, the following settings need to be configured in the YAML file:
>
>- datasource (postgresql)
>- google oauth2 (client_id & secret)
>- gmail smtp
